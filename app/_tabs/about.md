Hey there! I'm Suraj, a Senior DevOps Engineer with 9 years of experience in IT, specializing in Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Configuration Management, CI/CD, Automation and Observability in both conventional and cloud-native environments. I've worked with a diverse set of global clients, including international banks, telecommunication services, retail businesses and financial services.

I enjoy self-hosting, and this blog is a platform to share what I've learned while building my home server, in the hope that it proves valuable to others who appreciate the challenges of managing a personal server infrastructure. Whether you enjoy tinkering, breaking things or learning a thing or two along the way, I hope you find something useful here.

You can reach out to me at [{{ site.social.email }}](mailto:{{ site.social.email }}).
