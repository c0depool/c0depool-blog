## About

I enjoy self-hosting, and this blog is a platform to share what Iâ€™ve learned while building my home server, the DevOps practices I follow, the [source code](https://github.com/c0depool/c0depool-blog) of my setups, and much more. Since this blog is self-hosted at my home, if you ever encounter a `503` status code, please assume that my ISP has decided to shut down my internet for some reason, or my kid has unplugged some random cable from the server - a refurbished Asus Chromebox! I hope you find something useful here. ðŸ™‚
